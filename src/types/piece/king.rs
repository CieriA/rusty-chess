/// If the inside `bool` is `false`, it means that the `King` has never been moved.
/// ## King piece
/// It moves and eats in any direction, diagonally and non-diagonally, by 1 square.
///
/// It can't go in a square where it could get eaten.
///
/// If it has never been moved, the King can do a castle with one of the Rook,
/// if it also has never been moved,
/// moving the King (2, 0) (H1 rook) or (-2, 0) (A1 rook)
/// and the Rook next to the king in the opposite direction.
/// #### Win conditions
/// **Check**: When the King could get eaten the next turn if not moved.
/// - When in **check**, you must protect the King someway.
///
/// **Checkmate**: When the King is in **Check** and there's no way to get it out of **Check**
/// (it is, it can't be protected nor moved in a square where it isn't in **check**).
/// - If it happens, the player lose.
///
/// **Stalemate**: The king is the only _moveable_ piece, it is **not** in **check**
/// but all the squares it could go would put it in **check**.
/// - If it happens, it's a draw.
